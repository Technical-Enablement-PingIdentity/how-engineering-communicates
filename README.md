# How to communicate like a GitHub engineer: Our principles, practices, and tools

As a company that's been remote-first since day one, GitHub Engineering has learned a lot about how to communicate effectively across time zones, teams, and tools. We've distilled our experience into a set of guidelines that we call "how we communicate", and we're sharing them with you here. 

Unlike many companies that made the transition to remote work during the pandemic, GitHub has been majority remote since its founding. GitHub's remote-first communication style originally drew inspiration from the open source community. Open source development rarely requires the global community of collaborators and contributors to be in a certain place, at a certain time, in order to participate in the ongoing conversation. This is the same approach GitHub Engineering takes to our own internal communication. We believe that asynchronous communication is the best way to work globally and at scale, and as a result, we've built our culture around it.

We hope that by sharing our communication practices publicly, we can help other organizations that are embracing remote work or want to improve their collaboration culture. [Read this blog post]() to learn more about how we use GitHub to build GitHub, how we manage our internal communications signal-to-noise ratio, and how you can contribute to the ongoing conversation.
