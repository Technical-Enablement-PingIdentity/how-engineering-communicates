# How to communicate like a GitHub engineer: Our principles, practices, and tools

As a company that's been remote-first since day one, GitHub Engineering has learned a lot about how to communicate effectively across time zones, teams, and tools. We've distilled our experience into a set of guidelines that we call "How we communicate". We hope that by sharing our communication practices publicly, we can help other organizations that are embracing remote work or want to improve their collaboration culture. 

For more about how we use GitHub to build GitHub, how we turned our guiding communications principles into prescriptive practices to manage our internal communications signal-to-noise ratio, and how you can contribute to the ongoing conversation, check out [this blog post](https://github.blog/2023-10-04-how-to-communicate-like-a-github-engineer-our-principles-practices-and-tools/).
